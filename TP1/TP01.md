### Cryptography - https://cryptography.io/en/stable/

The cryptographic library that we'll mostly be using in this course is [cryptography](https://cryptography.io/en/stable/). This is a well-designed and well-documented library for Python offering a high-level API to different
‘Cryptographic Services’ (_recipes_). However, in the specific context of this course, we are going to make a ‘less standard’ use of it, by directly accessing the low-level functionality.

Installation:

The `pip` based installation method is suggested (see https://cryptography.io/en/latest/installation/).

```
pip3 install --upgrade pip
pip3 install cryptography
```

### QUESTION: Q1

What version of the `cryptography` library is installed?

Note that you can run the command below to print the version of the installed library: 

```bash
$ python3 -c ‘import cryptography; print(cryptography.__version__)’
```

### Answer:
```bash
└─$ python3 -c "import cryptography; print(cryptography.__version__)"
43.0.0
```
